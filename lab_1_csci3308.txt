cd - goes to root directory
cp old_file new_file - copies files
rm file_name - will remove the file
rmdir directory_name - removes directory
more file_name - view contents of file
less file_name - another way to view contents, does not keep in window
head file_name - shows beginning of file
sed file_name - another way to show beginning lines of file
tail file_name - shows end of a file
grep "the" file_name - search files for "the"
find "pwd" -name books.txt
zip dir.zip file_name(s) - zips file_name into a directory
unzip dir.zip - unzips file
tar -cf file_name.tar file_name(s)
tar -x file_name.tar - extract files
touch file_name - changes timestamp of file to now

Advanced UNIX Commands
sort-t":"-k1/etc/passwd - sort by UID
sort -n-t: -k3 /etc/passwd - sort by uid with only numbers
sort -n -t":"-k4 /etc/passwd | sort -n-t:-k3 -n - sort first based on GID then UID
grep -wn "Marx" /etc/passwd
wc -| file_name - get number of lines in a file
awk -d : -f1 /etc/passwd

//We tried to decode the given code puzzle into C++. Distinguishing between where the for while and if statements
belonged in the code in relation to each other was the most difficult part. Declaring where functions such as numbers was also difficult.
